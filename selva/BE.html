    <h1><u>BE</u></h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>A Bachelor of Engineering (BE) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded upon completion of a four-year program in various engineering disciplines. It is similar to a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree and is offered by many universities and technical institutions worldwide.</li>
        <li>The BE program focuses on providing students with a comprehensive understanding of engineering principles, theory, and practical applications in a specific branch of engineering</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
       <li> Mechanical Engineering</li>
        <li>Electrical Engineering</li>
       <li> Civil Engineering</li>
        <li>Computer Engineering</li>
        <li>Electronics Engineering</li>
       <li> Chemical Engineering</li>
       <li> Aerospace Engineering</li>
       <li> Biomedical Engineering</li>
        <li>Industrial Engineering</li>
       <li> Environmental Engineering</li>
        <li>Automobile Engineering</li>
        <li>Materials Engineering</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The curriculum of a BE program includes a mix of theoretical courses, laboratory work, projects, and internships. Students learn about fundamental engineering concepts, mathematics, physics, and design principles related to their chosen field of study.</li>
        <li>Upon completion of a BE degree, graduates are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue careers in engineering, research and development, manufacturing, construction, consulting, and other related industries. Some graduates may also choose to pursue further education by enrolling in master's or doctoral programs to specialize in specific areas of engineering or related fields.</li>
        <li>Overall, a BE degree prepares students to become competent engineers capable of applying their knowledge and skills to solve real-world engineering problems, innovate new technologies, and contribute to the development and advancement of society and industry.</li>
    </ul>
